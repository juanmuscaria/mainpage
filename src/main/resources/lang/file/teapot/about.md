Hey there, I'm Juan Patricio, aka "juanmuscaria". I'm a do-all dev, I like java and backend stuff.

Welcome to my website, the place of all my random projects, take a look around for anything interesting
or visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/juanmuscaria).

Some random stuff I'm doing right now located at [boldoTest](/boldoTest).

## Random REST APIs (almost always available, I think)

* `https://juanmuscaria.com/Minecraft.Download` - Replacement for the now
  dead `https://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download`. Automatically maps calls from the old asset host to the new
  piston-meta.mojang.com format.
