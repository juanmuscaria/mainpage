I'm a do-all software developer from Brazil with solid skills in Java and back-end development.\n\nWelcome to my website, the place of all my random web related projects, take a look around for anything interesting (maybe even try to locate my secret duck) or visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/juanmuscaria) to know more about me.\n\nBoldo (java on the browser module of my project) tests can be located at [boldoTest](/boldoTest).\n\n## Random REST APIs\n* `https://juanmuscaria.com/Minecraft.Download/` - Replacement for the now dead `https://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download`.
